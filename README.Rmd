# program-objectives

A place for discussion of UTSC statistics program objectives, with curriculum map for program review in mind.

## Files:

- `program-objectives.txt`: a sketch of some things students ought to be able to do by the end of their programs. Indented points are subpoints of main points (starting at the beginning of the line).
- `applied-minor-courses.txt`: a list of (our) courses in the Applied Minor program.

## my aims (with R)

- to make a numbered list of program objectives, 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) etc
- to make a blank curriculum map spreadsheet for each program (once I have the courses for that program)

spreadsheets can then be filled in eg. with colour to illustrate how the courses contribute to the program objectives.
